# References

Place supporting documentation here that Claude can read for deeper context.

## Guidelines

- Keep reference docs focused on specific topics
- Use markdown format for consistency
- Link from SKILL.md when relevant
- Claude loads these files only when needed (progressive disclosure)

## Example Structure

```
references/
├── api-guide.md      # API documentation
├── examples.md       # Extended examples
├── troubleshooting.md # Common issues and solutions
└── glossary.md       # Domain-specific terminology
```
