## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) CLI installed
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for Python dependency management
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Git for version control

### Fork and Clone

1. **Fork this repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork locally**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/claude-code-extensions.git
   cd claude-code-extensions
   ```

3. **Add upstream remote**:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/claude-code-extensions.git
   ```

### Install Development Tools

```bash
# Install uv if you haven't already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install Python (if needed)
uv python install 3.11

# Test the installer
./install_extensions.py --help
```

## Development Workflow

### Creating a Branch

Always create a new branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

**Branch naming conventions**:
- `feature/` - New features or extensions
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test additions or improvements

### Keeping Your Fork Updated

Regularly sync with the upstream repository:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

## Creating Extensions

### Creating Agents

**Use the meta-agent** for best results:

```bash
# In Claude Code, from this repository
> Use the meta-agent to create a [description] expert agent
```

The meta-agent will:
- Fetch latest Claude Code documentation
- Generate a complete, production-ready agent
- Write to `.claude/agents/` with proper structure

**Manual creation**:

1. Choose the right category: `core/`, `orchestrators/`, `universal/`, or `specialized/<tech>/`
2. Use this template:

```markdown
---
name: your-agent-name
description: When this agent should be invoked (be specific and action-oriented)
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash  # Optional - omit to inherit all tools
---

# Agent System Prompt

Your agent's instructions here...
```

3. Follow the [agent best practices](#agent-guidelines)

### Creating Hooks

1. **Choose the right lifecycle event**: PreToolUse, PostToolUse, SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, PreCompact, Stop, SubagentStop, Notification

2. **Use Python with uv script format**:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.11"
# dependencies = [
#     "python-dotenv",
# ]
# ///

import json
import sys

def main():
    try:
        input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)
        # Your hook logic here
        sys.exit(0)  # 0 = success, 2 = block operation
    except Exception:
        sys.exit(0)  # Always fail gracefully

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

3. **Make it executable**: `chmod +x .claude/hooks/your_hook.py`

4. **Test it locally** (see [Testing Hooks](#testing-hooks))

### Creating Commands

1. Create a markdown file in `.claude/commands/`:

```markdown
---
description: Brief description of what this command does
argument-hint: [arg1] [arg2]  # Optional
allowed-tools: Bash(git:*)  # Optional
model: claude-3-5-haiku-20241022  # Optional
---

Your command prompt here. Use:
- $ARGUMENTS for all arguments
- $1, $2, $3 for individual arguments
- @file/path for file references
- !`bash command` for executed commands
```

2. Test the command: `/your-command-name`

### Creating Output Styles

1. Create a markdown file in `.claude/output-styles/`:

```markdown
---
name: Style Name
description: Brief description of what this style does
---

# Custom System Prompt

You are an interactive CLI tool that helps users with [specific purpose].

## Behaviors

[Define specific behaviors, tone, output format]
```

## Testing Your Changes

### Testing Hooks

Create test input and verify exit codes:

```bash
# Example: Test pre_tool_use.py
echo '{"tool_name": "Bash", "tool_input": {"command": "ls"}}' > test.json
uv run ./.claude/hooks/pre_tool_use.py < test.json
echo $?  # Should be 0 (allow) or 2 (block)

# Test with dangerous command
echo '{"tool_name": "Bash", "tool_input": {"command": "rm -rf /"}}' > test.json
uv run ./.claude/hooks/pre_tool_use.py < test.json
echo $?  # Should be 2 (blocked)
```

### Testing Agents

1. Install the agent in a test project:

   ```bash
   ./install_extensions.py install --type agent --category core ~/test-project
   ```

2. Test invocation in Claude Code:

   ```
   > Use the [your-agent-name] agent to [perform task]
   ```

3. Verify it produces expected results and follows its instructions

### Testing Commands

```bash
# In Claude Code
/your-command-name arg1 arg2
```

### Testing the Installer

```bash
# Dry run to preview changes
./install_extensions.py install --dry-run ~/test-project

# Test specific extension type
./install_extensions.py install --type hook --no-interactive ~/test-project
```

## Style Guidelines

### Agent Guidelines

- **Single responsibility**: Each agent should have one clear purpose
- **Explicit triggers**: Use "MUST BE USED" or "use PROACTIVELY" in descriptions
- **Tool restrictions**: Only grant necessary tools for security and focus
- **Clear instructions**: Write step-by-step workflows in the system prompt
- **Delegation patterns**: Orchestrators delegate; specialists implement
- **Output formats**: Define structured output for reports/analysis

### Hook Guidelines

- **Fail gracefully**: Always `sys.exit(0)` on errors to prevent blocking Claude Code
- **Log everything**: Append to `logs/<hook_name>.json` for audit trails
- **Fast execution**: Hooks should complete quickly (< 1 second ideal)
- **Use type hints**: Make Python code maintainable with proper typing
- **Document safety**: Explain any blocking logic in comments

### Command Guidelines

- **Clear argument hints**: Use `argument-hint` to guide users
- **Minimal tool access**: Only request `allowed-tools` you need
- **Self-documenting**: Write clear prompts that explain what they do
- **Examples in description**: Help users understand when to use the command

### Python Code Style

- **PEP 8 compliant**: Follow Python style guidelines
- **Use type hints**: Improve code clarity and catch errors
- **Descriptive names**: Functions and variables should be self-documenting
- **Comments for "why"**: Explain reasoning, not what (code shows what)
- **Error handling**: Catch specific exceptions, always have fallbacks

### Documentation Style

- **Clear headings**: Use proper markdown hierarchy
- **Code examples**: Include working examples for every feature
- **Concise**: Get to the point quickly
- **Scannable**: Use bullets, tables, and formatting for easy reading
- **Complete**: Don't assume prior knowledge
