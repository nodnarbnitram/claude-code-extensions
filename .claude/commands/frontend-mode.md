description: Load Ultracite rules for JS/TS development
---

Load @docs/ultracite.md and strictly follow all rules for this session.

Apply these standards to all JS/TS/JSX/TSX code:
- Maximum type safety (no `any`, explicit types)
- Accessibility requirements (ARIA, semantic HTML)
- React/Next.js best practices
- Code quality and correctness rules

When writing or reviewing code, validate against Ultracite rules and fix violations proactively.
