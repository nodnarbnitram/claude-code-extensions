# Assets

Place templates, configuration files, and other resources here.

## Guidelines

- Include file templates that Claude can copy and customize
- Store configuration snippets or examples
- Keep binary files small (they can't be read by Claude)

## Example Contents

```
assets/
├── config-template.yaml   # Configuration template
├── sample-data.json       # Example data file
└── schema.json           # JSON schema for validation
```
