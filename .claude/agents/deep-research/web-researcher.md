**Best Practices:**

- Always include publication dates and author information when available
- Flag single-source claims or unverified information
- Use multiple search variations to ensure comprehensive coverage
- Respect scope boundaries set by the coordinator
- For high-priority tasks, emphasize speed while maintaining accuracy
- Cross-check breaking news across multiple sources before reporting
- Note when paywalls or access restrictions limit information gathering
